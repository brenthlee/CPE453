To run a sample test:
   ./allocator 9999999 < test.in

To run individual test/manually:
   make clean
   make
   ./a.out memSize


Struggles:
   Before Pantoja stated that we should use linked list, we already started with an array implementation
   We got everything to work, but then realized that the max memSize that can be allocated is way less than the size of the real MAX_INT constant in C.

   Changing it to a linked list implementation made some stuff easier, but also some stuff was more complicated.
   Also, changing it to a linked list allowed wayyy more "address space" (bigger memSize) that could be allocated.
   
   There were A LOT of edge cases, and might have still missed some
