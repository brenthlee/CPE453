To run a sample test:
   ./allocator 9999999 < test.in

To run individual test/manually:
   make clean
   make
   ./a.out memSize


Struggles:
   Before Pantoja stated that we should use linked list, we already started with an array implementation
   We got everything to work, but then realized that the max memSize that can be allocated is MAX_INT/sizeof(int), so it would only work with 1/4 of the real maximum

   Changing it to a linked list implementation made some stuff easier, but also some stuff was more complicated
   
   There were A LOT of edge cases, and might have still missed some
